# LeapLabsCodingTest

A few notes about the test:
- It was really fun! When I saw the task I knew immediately that I wanted to
  implement a PGA attack, which I had actually never coded up myself before. It
  was nice to get that working and see it in action 
- I feel like I spent most of my time downloading and getting the dataset to
  work. I probably should've used some other dataset but I started with this
  because resnet was pre-trained on imagenet and this was a lightweight dataset
  that would work out of the box. I don't think the files are too big so it
  should be easy to git clone the whole thing, but apologies in advance if this
  becomes a problem!
